IGEN 230 PlantStalk Code

This project contains the team's work for the IGEN 230 team project Android app, PlantStalk. The app communicates to an Arduino Bluno module, and displays information based on sensor readings from this communication.

## Tools
* This code was developed with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and used the [relevant documentation](https://developer.android.com/docs) for features 
* To inform our approach to setting up the Bluetooth communication we use [this DFRobot tutorial](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Bluno_SKU_DFR0267)

## Setup
1. Open these files in Android Studio
   
1. Either connect your Android phone (Oreo or above) to your computer via a local cable connection, or launch a virtual Android phone.

1. Click run and see the app in action! Since we cannot distribute our sensor module, this app runs on dummy arrays which show the conceptual work of the graphs and UI.
   
## ToDo
* Update Bluetooth functionality
